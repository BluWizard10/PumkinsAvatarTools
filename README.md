# PumkinsAvatarTools
An editor script that adds tools to help you setup avatars faster and easier. It includes a component copier that makes it a lot easier to reimport your avatars, and tools to make your thumbnails nicer.

- To install drag the downloaded `unity package`  Make sure you have the latest VRChat SDK and the right Unity version. If you do, just run the package to import it to your currently open project!

- To launch the tool go to `Pumkin > Tools > Avatar Tools` in your Unity project.

- If you're having any issues with the tool, try resetting it's settings by going to `Pumkin > Tools > Reset Tool Preferences`

Also check out the new [Wiki](https://github.com/rurre/PumkinsAvatarTools/wiki) for a more detailed explanation of what everything does.
