# PumkinsAvatarTools
An editor script that adds tools to help you setup avatars faster and easier. It includes a component copier that makes it a lot easier to reimport your avatars, and tools to make your thumbnails nicer.

- To install head over to [releases](https://github.com/rurre/PumkinsAvatarTools/releases/latest) and grab the latest `unity package` at the bottom of the top post. Make sure you have the latest VRChat SDK and the right Unity version. If you do, just run the package to import it to your currently open project!

- To launch the tool go to `Tools > Pumkin > Avatar Tools` in your Unity project.

- If you're having any issues with the tool, try resetting it's settings by going to `Tools > Pumkin > Reset Tool Preferences`

Also check out the new [Wiki](https://github.com/rurre/PumkinsAvatarTools/wiki) for a more detailed explanation of what everything does.

I also have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7vyekJv)! Join it to stay up to date with this tool's updates. At least until I make an auto updater.

**Important:** Since this is an editor script it needs to be in a folder called `Editor` anywhere in your project.

**Disclaimer:** This tool is in beta and could *break everything*. Please backup your avatars. And use at your own risk.
