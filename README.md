# Pumkin's Avatar Tools
An editor script that adds tools to help you setup avatars faster and easier. It includes a component copier that makes it a lot easier to reimport your avatars, and tools to make your thumbnails nicer.

To install these tools grab the `.unitypackage` from [releases](https://github.com/rurre/PumkinsAvatarTools/releases/latest) then simply import it into your unity project.
**Make sure to delete any older versions of Pumkin Tools from your project before importing**

Also make sure that you are using the [correct version of Unity](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/current-unity-version) and the [latest version of the VRChat SDK2](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/setting-up-the-sdk)
